This project explores AVL Tree experimentation. It loads dataset entries into an AVL Tree, processes query terms, and reports search results. The AVL Tree is instrumented to measure comparisons during insert and search. Experiments vary dataset size to compare best, average, and worst-case performance with theoretical AVL behaviour. Results, graphs, and required university-provided files are included.
